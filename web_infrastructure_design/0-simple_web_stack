Specifics about this infrastructure.

A server :
A server is a hardware device or software that accepts and responds to requests over a network.
It provides functionality for other programs or devices, known as clients.
It's usually located in special facilities called data centers.
A server can be both physical and virtual.
A physical server is a dedicated computer that hosts applications and services.
A virtual server or VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a system for converting a physical server into several
independent virtual machines (VMs) that act autonomously like a physical device.
A server runs an operating system (OS), which is software that manages the system's hardware and software 
resources and provides services to a number of programs.


Domain names's role :
They serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services,
with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols. 
A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances.

Type of DNS record is “www” in “www.foobar.com :
The DNS record for “www” is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name). 
It acts as an alias, redirecting queries to another domain name an IP address.

Web server's role :
A web server hosts and serves web pages and other resources to users via the Internet.
It responds to HTTP requests from browsers by sending the necessary files (such as HTML documents, images, etc.).
These web pages are generally static, meaning that they are preconceived and do not change according to the user.

Application server's role :
An application server hosts the business logic of an application. It handles transactions, security, and access to hosted files.
Application servers are used to run complex and dynamic content.

Database's role :
A database stores, manages, and retrieves data. It is used to store structured information, such as user data, products, etc.
Applications connect to the database to retrieve or store data.

Server's communication by computer with users :
The server communicates with the user’s computer via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
When a browser requests a file hosted on the server, it sends an HTTP request, and the server responds with the requested file via HTTP.

Issues are with this infrastructure

SPOF :
A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) refers to a component or system within an IT infrastructure that, if it fails, can lead to the entire system’s breakdown.

Downtime :
When maintenance is required (such as deploying new code), the web server needs to be restarted.
During this restart, the website may experience downtime, rendering it inaccessible to users.
Frequent restarts can disrupt user experience and impact business continuity.

Scale in traffic :
If the infrastructure cannot handle a sudden surge in incoming traffic, it lacks scalability.
Scalability ensures that the system can accommodate increased load without compromising performance. 
Without proper scalability measures, the website may become slow, unresponsive, or even crash during peak traffic periods.
